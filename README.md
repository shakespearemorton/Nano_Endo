Endocytosis of nanoparticles using the Cooke-Deserno potential.

## Step 1: Create a membrane

Run membrane.py, and set the size of your membrane. The size is related to the box size of the system, and lipids are placed on an HCP lattice.
Larger membranes may need more time to equilibrate, or may be unstable. 

## Step 2: Equilibrate Membrane

Use the LAMMPS code provided to equilibrate the membrane. Again, larger membranes take longer to relax.

## Step 3:
